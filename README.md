# Visualisation-Design-Task--using-Coca-Cola-dataset

# Introduction
The Coca-Cola Corporation, an American business founded in 1892, is best known for producing Coca-Cola (Wikipedia, 2023). More than 200 nations and territories deliver the products from The Coca-Cola Corporation (Coca-Cola, 2021). The business expanded with the goal of refreshing the world. Its next stage of growth aims to develop the brands and beverage options that consumers prefer, reviving them both physically and emotionally (Coca-Cola, 2021). 

Coca-Cola is a global brand with a wide range of products and significant market share. Hence, it generates a lot of data that needs to be analysed and visualized to identify trends and patterns that can aid decision-making. In this project, we will use Tableau to create comprehensive data visualisation to help Coca-Cola executives make informed decisions based on sales and profitability.

# Data
The Coca-Cola dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMJ2TxHJkzHbJv1eu7d1sohnGjJMra9y/edit#gid=1667307.

This dataset provides valuable insights into the sales performance of Coca-Cola brands across different regions, states, and cities in the United States.

# Persona and question
The persona is Sarah Johnson, who is a Sales Analyst at Coca-Cola Company with several years of experience in the beverage industry. She is responsible for analysing sales and profitability data of Coca-Cola products across different localities in United States. Her main goal is to provide insights and recommendations to the sales team and management to help them make informed decisions on product distribution, pricing strategies and marketing campaigns. Sarah needs to stay up-to-date with the latest 
sales and profitability trends, monitor the performance of different products, and identify areas of improvement.

She has two specific questions:

Q1. What is the relationship between price per unit and unit sold, and how does this affect total 
sales and operating profit?

Q2. Are there variations in customer preferences for Coca-Cola products throughout various 
seasons, states, cities, and regions, and how does this affect total sales and profitability?
