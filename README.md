# Visualisation-Design-Task--using-Coca-Cola-dataset

# Introduction
The Coca-Cola Corporation, an American business founded in 1892, is best known for producing Coca-Cola (Wikipedia, 2023). More than 200 nations and territories deliver the products from The Coca-Cola Corporation (Coca-Cola, 2021). The business expanded with the goal of refreshing the world. Its next stage of growth aims to develop the brands and beverage options that consumers prefer, reviving them both physically and emotionally (Coca-Cola, 2021). 

Coca-Cola is a global brand with a wide range of products and significant market share. Hence, it generates a lot of data that needs to be analysed and visualized to identify trends and patterns that can aid decision-making. In this project, we will use Tableau to create comprehensive data visualisation to help Coca-Cola executives make informed decisions based on sales and profitability.

# Data
The Coca-Cola dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMJ2TxHJkzHbJv1eu7d1sohnGjJMra9y/edit#gid=1667307.

This dataset provides valuable insights into the sales performance of Coca-Cola brands across different regions, states, and cities in the United States.

# Persona and question
The persona is Sarah Johnson, who is a Sales Analyst at Coca-Cola Company with several years of experience in the beverage industry. She is responsible for analysing sales and profitability data of Coca-Cola products across different localities in United States. Her main goal is to provide insights and recommendations to the sales team and management to help them make informed decisions on product distribution, pricing strategies and marketing campaigns. Sarah needs to stay up-to-date with the latest 
sales and profitability trends, monitor the performance of different products, and identify areas of improvement.

She has two specific questions:

Q1. What is the relationship between price per unit and unit sold, and how does this affect total 
sales and operating profit?

Q2. Are there variations in customer preferences for Coca-Cola products throughout various 
seasons, states, cities, and regions, and how does this affect total sales and profitability?

# Result

# Tableau:

We made the dashboard interactive by allowing the user to filter the data by Beverage Brand, Month of Invoice Date, Retailer, Region, State, and City.

# PowerBI:

Power BI's main advantages are the ability to easily add slicers or filters and the ability to customise the dashboard canvas with a backdrop image or colour. Power BI offers three different forms of filtering: basic filtering, advanced filtering, and top-N filtering. It is easier to implement than Tableau because users can create dashboards directly, instead of having to develop individual worksheets and then integrate them.

With Power BI, we put the same dashboard into practise. Although the implementation process was like that of Tableau, there were some changes between two programme’s user interfaces and functions. But using both techniques, we were able to produce a dashboard that is interactive and pleasing to the eye and can respond to Sarah Johnson's two research objectives.

# Walkthrough

Q1. What is the relationship between price per unit and unit sold, and how does this affect total sales and operating profit?

To answer this question, I have created a bar chart with "Price per Unit" on the x-axis and "Units Sold" on the y-axis. The correlation between Price per Unit and Unit Sold is depicted in the figure below. The graph clearly shows that, number of units sold is at its highest when the Price per Unit is at its average, or 0.5. And it starts to fall off to either side.

Following figure makes it clear that total sales ($1220050) and operating profit ($452069) are at their maximum when the price per unit is at its average and the number of units sold is at its highest.

Also, we can observe from below figures that operating profit and total sales are decreasing on each side. The number of units sold decreases when the price rises by more than 0.5.

Q2.	Are there variations in customer preferences for Coca-Cola products throughout various seasons, states, cities, and regions, and how does this affect total sales and profitability?

To answer, we have created a Line graph which shows the total sales during different seasons and a Treemap which depicts the sum of units sold by different cities, states, and regions.

The four distinct seasons that the United States has are spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, and August), fall (Autumn) (September, October, and November), and winter (December, January, and February). The line graph from above figure demonstrates that overall beverage sales peaked in the summer (June, July, and August), started to fall at the beginning of autumn, and then started to rise again towards the end of autumn until the beginning of winter. Around December, it reaches its peak. The winter months of January and February have the lowest sales, followed by the early-autumn months of September and October.

From the above visualizations, it is clear that, all of the beverage brands owned by the Coca-Cola Company—Coca-Cola, Dasani Water, Diet Coke, Fanta, Powerade and Sprite—are following the same seasonal pattern. Hence, there is no distinct seasonal consumer preference. All brands follow the same trend.

Here shows the sum of units sold by States, Cities, and Regions. When the blue colour is deep, it signifies that more units have been sold overall. When it is lighter, less units have been sold. The more units sold, the lighter the hue is, and the more units sold, the darker it is.

To determine whether there are any regional differences in customer preference: Choose "Midwest" as the region from the filter, then "Coca-Cola" as the beverage choice. Now, total sales are ($811800) and operating profit is ($130722). Here, DreamCo and Sodapop's combined sales make up the total sales. Similarly, analyse all beverage brands in Midwest area. Now change the region, and analyse each beverage brand in that region. Use same process to determine customer preferences across all states, cities, and regions.


According to the analysis, consumers in the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast had similar preferences for beverage brands. Coca-Cola is preferred over Dasani Water, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade and Fanta, in that order. Coca-Cola is the most popular beverage among consumers in Western region, followed by Diet Coke, Sprite, Dasani Water, Fanta, and Powerade. Again, Coca-Cola takes the lead in the southern region, followed by Diet Coke, Dasani Water, Sprite, Fanta and Powerade. Within a city/state, there is no discernible difference in consumer choice.
An important consideration in determining the overall sales and operating profit of beverage brands across regions is the operating margin. Despite having the most units sold (988750) and total sales ($549717) of Coca-Cola, the western region comes in second in operating profit ($193235), while the northeast region, which is second in both units sold (922450) and total sales ($498184), comes out on top with an operating profit of $207498 due to a higher operating margin (0.4) than the western region (0.35).

# Conclusion

Analysing Coca-Cola’s sales and profitability was the overall goal of our study, which was successfully accomplished. To answer our research questions, we were able to create interactive dashboards and visualisations using Tableau and Power BI.

Through the analysis, we were able to determine how the price per unit and unit sold are related to one another and how this influences overall sales and operating profit. In addition, we identified seasonal, state, city, and regional differences in consumer preferences for Coca-Cola products, with the Northeast region having the highest operating profit despite not having the largest total sales.

Overall, Sarah was able to obtain knowledge about Coca-Cola sales and profit statistics through this project that could be used to make informed business decisions.
